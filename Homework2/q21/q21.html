<!-- 21. This is related to the EMU table project. Add the following feature to the page. A small box
containing the word EMU always follows the mouse pointer. The box touches the pointer and it
is located below the pointer so that it does not hide anything above the pointer. Initially the box
is not on the page. As soon as the mouse pointer enters the page, the box starts to follow the
pointer. The box follows the pointer regardless of the pointer moves or not. When the mouse
pointer exits the page, the box disappears. Use appropriate css style for box and word. -->
